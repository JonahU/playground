# Playground

Archive of demo iOS project from Sept 2017.

## How it works

There are 5 segments, 4 mini apps and a home screen. The layout was inspired by Snapchat's interface, swipe in desired direction to access the desired mini app, swipe back to return to the home screen. The 4 apps are: 
* (Top) step counter using HealthKit 
* (Bottom) FlappyBird-like game using SpriteKit
* (Left) directions to Empire State Building using MapKit & CoreLocation
* (Right) Selfie-Camera using AVFoundation
